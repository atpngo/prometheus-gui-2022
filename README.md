### Installing and Setting up the Actual GUI :(
Go to this link: https://github.com/atpngo/prometheus-gui-2022.git 

Click on the green Code button and then “Download ZIP” OR use this command in a terminal window: 
```
git clone https://github.com/atpngo/prometheus-gui-2022.git  
```

Unzip the file and put it anywhere you want
Open the folder by right clicking the directory and clicking “Open with Visual Studio Code”

Open up a browser window and go to localhost:3000
Make a fake login or whatever it doesn’t rly matter
Go to Configuration -> Api Keys


Add a new API key, calling it whatever you want.

<b>LEAVE THE TIME TO LIVE BOX EMPTY SO THAT THE KEY DOES NOT EXPIRE.</b>

Copy that API key and paste it in the api-key.txt file
Then run the ```replace-bearer.py``` file
This bad boy is gonna fix all the conf files so that they work with your api key :)
Next, go to Grafana and hit that plus sign and click on import

Find the ```dashboard.json``` file in the ground-systems folder and upload it
Yay i think thats it for Windows

### Actually Running the GUI
1. Open up that dashboard
2. If in ground-systems, open the ```windows``` directory and run the two powershell scripts in there (right click -> run with Powershell)
- ```start-telegraf.ps1```
- ```start-telegraf-2.ps1```
